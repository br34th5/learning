Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one: border-box.

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

The code in the example above resets the box model to border-box for all HTML elements.
 This new box model avoids the dimensional issues that exist in the former box model you learned about.

In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed.
 The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.

The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.
The value for the new box model is border-box.
The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding
