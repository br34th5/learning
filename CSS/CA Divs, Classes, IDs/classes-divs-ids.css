It's possible, however, for multiple elements on a web page to share a specific styling, but for one of those elements to differ slightly.

.breaking {
  font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;
}

p.breaking {
  line-height: 1.3em;
}

The .breaking selector targets all elements with a class of breaking.
The p.breaking selector targets only <p> elements with a class of breaking.

.first, .last {
  font-size: 20px;
}

Multiple classes

<h1 class="book domestic">The Way of the Deep</h1>

<h1 class="book foreign">A Night in the Sky</h1>

.book {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}

.domestic {
  font-color: #0902CC;
}

.foreign {
  font-color: #B097DD;
}

Div

You can think of the div as a box, or container, that groups elements that belong together.
For example, a <div> can be used to group together all of the elements that make up the navigation for a web page.
