Great job! In this lesson, you learned how to modify image properties, add background images, set repetition and placement, and create linear gradients.

Let's review what you've learned so far:

Image dimensions are set using the width and height properties.
A background image can be added to any element using the background-image property.
A background image's repetition is controlled with the background-repeat property.
The position of a non-repeating image can be controlled using the background-position property.
The background property is a shorthand way of setting an image, repetition, and it's position.
The background-image also supports color gradients.
