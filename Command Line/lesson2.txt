You learned how to use the command line to view and manipulate the filesystem. What can we generalize so far?

Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt

From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories
Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories
