Great work! Let's review what you accomplished in this unit:

Installed Jekyll
Used Jekyll to generate a static site
Started a local server to view your site

...

You now have your site published on the public Internet. You can now navigate to your newly published website in your preferred browser.

The URL for your GitHub Pages site is: your-user-name.github.io, where your-user-name is your actual GitHub username.

Let's review what you accomplished in this unit:

Created a GitHub account
Created the required GitHub repo
Used Git to add, commit, and push your website to the repo
Succesfully used GitHub Pages to deploy your site to the Internet!
Note that your site's URL matches your repo's name â€” a GitHub Pages requirement. But what if you want to change the URL to a custom URL?

In the next unit, you'll learn how to keep your site hosted on GitHub, but change the URL to something besides the GitHub Pages default.
