Now that you've merged origin/master into your local master branch, you're ready to contribute some work of your own. The workflow for Git collaborations typically follows this order:

Fetch and merge changes from the remote
Create a branch to work on a new project feature
Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
Push your branch up to the remote for review

Steps 1 and 4 are a safeguard against merge conflicts, which occur when two branches contain file changes that cannot be merged with the git merge command. Step 5 involves git push,
 a command you will learn in the next exercise.
