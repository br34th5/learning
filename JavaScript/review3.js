Way to go! We just learned a lot of control flow concepts:

if/else statements make binary decisions and execute separate code based on a condition.
We can add extra conditions with to if/else statements with else if conditions.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read, however they achieve the same result as if/else statements.
Comparison operators, like <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables. After they compare, they always return either true or false.
Logical Operators, like &&, ||, !==, and !, can compare two variables to see if a certain condition exists:
&& checks if both sides are true.
|| checks if either side is true.
!== checks if both sides are not equal.
! changes a variable that is true to false, and vice versa.

In the next lesson, we'll learn about functions, and how to write blocks of code that are reusable
