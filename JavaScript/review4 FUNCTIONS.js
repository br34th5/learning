This unit introduced you to functions.

Functions are written to perform a task.
Functions take data or variables, perform a set of tasks on them, and then return the result.
We can define parameters when calling the function.
When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.
Great work so far. Next up: Scope! Scope informs us where variables are accessible from within our programs.
