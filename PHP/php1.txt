PHP is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser,
 build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies
  (little packets of data that your browser uses to remember things, like if you're logged in to Codecademy).

The PHP code is written in the <?php and ?> 

Differences between JS and PHP:

JS generally runs in the browser, or client. This means it only really knows what's going on in your browser,
 plus whatever information it gets from the website(s) you're connecting to.

PHP runs on the same computer as the website you're visiting, which is known as the server. 
 This means that it has access to all the information and files on that machine, 
 which allows it to construct custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies,
  and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.


<?php 
echo "My first line of php :D";
?>

!!! You might have noticed that our main file is now index.php instead of index.html. This is important! !!!
 It tells the PHP interpreter that there's PHP code in the file to evaluate.


The echo function outputs strings.

<?php
   echo "Hello," . " " . "world" . "!";
?> // the dot does the same thing for strings that + does in JavaScript


PHP can also do math.
<?php
  echo 5 * 7;
?>
